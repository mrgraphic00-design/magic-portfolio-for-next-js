## Master's Thesis Project

Currently working on my Master's thesis focusing on the techno-economic optimization of the OTH Amberg campus energy system.

## Project Overview

**Institution:** Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Amberg-Weiden  
**Duration:** February 2026 - August 2026  
**Status:** Ongoing

## Objectives

- Minimize Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)
- Maximize renewable energy integration
- Achieve significant CO₂ emission reductions
- Optimize component sizing for PV arrays, battery storage, and heat pumps

## Methodology

### Energy System Modeling

Using PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis) and Oemof frameworks to model the campus energy system including:
- Photovoltaic arrays
- Battery energy storage systems
- BEV 
- Heat pumps, Boilers, and CHP for sector coupling
- Grid connection optimization

### Data Analysis

- Load profile analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Time-series data processing for electrical and thermal demand
- Component sizing optimization using linear programming

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for data analysis and optimization
- **PyPSA** for power system analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Polysun** for PV system simulation

## Expected Results

- Up to 20% CO₂ reduction potential through optimized renewable integration
- Cost-optimized system configuration
- LCOE analysis demonstrating economic viability
- Quantified benefits of sector coupling
