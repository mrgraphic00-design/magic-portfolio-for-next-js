## Project Overview

Designed and simulated two competing rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system configurations for a reference building in Bavaria, Germany, using the **Polysun** simulation environment. The project compared a purely economical design (minimum LCOE) against an ecological design (maximum CO₂ savings), highlighting the trade-offs between financial return and environmental impact.

## Objectives

- Design a PV system under two different optimisation targets: minimal cost vs. maximal CO₂ reduction
- Simulate hourly energy yield, self-consumption rate, and grid feed-in
- Calculate and compare Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) and CO₂ footprint for both configurations

## System Configurations

### Economical Configuration
- **Module type:** Standard polycrystalline, lower cost per Wp
- **Tilt & orientation:** Optimised for maximum annual yield (south-facing, 35° tilt)
- **Battery storage:** Minimal capacity to maximise self-consumption without over-investment
- **Result:** Lower upfront investment, shorter payback period (~9 years)

### Ecological Configuration
- **Module type:** High-efficiency monocrystalline with lower carbon manufacturing footprint
- **Tilt & orientation:** Adjusted to flatten summer peak and improve autumn/winter generation
- **Battery storage:** Larger capacity to maximise self-consumption and reduce grid dependency
- **Result:** Higher CO₂ savings over system lifetime, longer payback (~13 years)

## Key Results

| Metric | Economical | Ecological |
|---|---|---|
| LCOE (€/kWh) | 0.089 | 0.114 |
| Self-consumption (%) | 62% | 78% |
| CO₂ avoided (t/year) | 1.8 | 2.6 |
| Payback period (years) | 9 | 13 |

## Technologies Used

- **Polysun** — full-year hourly PV simulation
- **Microsoft Excel** — LCOE and CO₂ footprint calculations
- **Python (Matplotlib)** — comparative charts and sensitivity analysis

## Conclusion

The comparison demonstrates that the most economically attractive solution is not always the most sustainable one. Policymakers and building owners need to weigh financial incentives against long-term environmental commitments when choosing a PV configuration.
