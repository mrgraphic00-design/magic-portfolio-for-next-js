## Project Overview

Designed and analysed a hybrid energy management system (EMS) for a residential city quarter as part of the Master's programme at OTH Amberg-Weiden. The goal was to minimise both energy costs and CO₂ emissions while maintaining reliable supply to all consumers.

## Objectives

- Develop a cost-optimised and CO₂-minimised dispatch strategy for a multi-source energy system
- Integrate renewable sources,(PV) with conventional backup and storage
- Quantify the trade-off between economic and ecological optimisation targets

## Methodology

### Load Profile Analysis

- Collected and cleaned hourly electrical and thermal demand data for the district
- Applied time-series analysis using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to identify peak demand periods and seasonal patterns

### System Modelling

- Modelled the hybrid system consisting of:
  - Rooftop solar PV arrays
  - Heat Pump
  - Gas/Biomass boiler and combined heat and power (CHP) unit
  - Grid connection (import/export)
- Formulated a linear programming optimisation problem to minimise total cost while respecting technical and environmental constraints

### Optimisation & Results

- Implemented the optimisation in **Python** (CBC linear solver)
- Achieved up to **5% reduction in annual energy costs** compared to a grid-only baseline
- Demonstrated a **20% decrease in CO₂ emissions** through optimised renewable dispatch and storage scheduling

## Technologies Used

- **Python** — core modelling and optimisation
- **Pandas & NumPy** — data processing and time-series analysis
- **Matplotlib** — visualisation of load profiles, cost curves, and dispatch schedules
- **CBC** — linear programming solver

## Key Takeaways

This project reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in energy system planning. Combining load forecasting with mixed-integer linear programming enables planners to balance economic viability and environmental responsibility in residential energy systems.
